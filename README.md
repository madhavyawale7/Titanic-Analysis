# Objective

This project aims to utilize Power BI for in-depth analysis and visualization of the Titanic dataset, uncovering intricate details about the passengers' demographics, survival rates, and voyage particulars. By leveraging interactive visualizations and data exploration techniques, the objective is to discern patterns and correlations within the data, shedding light on the factors influencing survival outcomes. Through this comprehensive examination, the project seeks to offer insights into the historical narrative of the Titanic disaster from a nuanced, data-driven perspective.

# Dashboard

# Insights

1. **Survival Disparity**: There was a significant difference in survival rates between male and female passengers, with a notably higher proportion of females surviving compared to males.

2. **Age Distribution**: The majority of passengers fell within the age range of 20 to 30 years old, with a smaller number of children (0-10 years) and older adults (60+ years) onboard.

3. **Fare Variability**: While most passengers paid relatively low fares, there were outliers who paid substantially higher fares, possibly indicating differences in accommodation or socioeconomic status.

4. **Embarkation Port Preferences**: Southampton was the most common embarkation port, followed by Cherbourg and Queenstown, suggesting varying travel origins and routes.

5. **Class Disparities**: There were differences in passenger demographics across different passenger classes, with a higher proportion of males in the lower classes and a higher proportion of females in the higher classes.

6. **Survival by Passenger Class**: Survival rates varied significantly across passenger classes, with first-class passengers having the highest survival rate, followed by second-class passengers, and then third-class passengers.

7. **Age and Fare Correlation**: There was a weak positive correlation between passenger age and the fare paid for the ticket, indicating that older passengers may have paid slightly higher fares on average.
